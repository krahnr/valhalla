Improvements:
Smoother character movement
Random seed before "discovering" item attributes - AND/OR - improve curses. you only discover whether an item is cursed after
using it for a while. e.g. you can notice that it isn't performing well in combat after one or two battles, despite appearing
to have good attributes. if you're lucky, you get a message ~"something about this weapon feels off".  After using it one or
two more times, a message will pop up saying that you have realized the item is cursed, but you can't bring yourself to remove 
it.

Better combat: slower, take turns instead of instantaneous
Reveal rolls in combat
Fewer obviously inferior items.
Show object attributes within GUI
Icons above village buildings
Single-use items like scrolls and potions are more useful - they are your first introduction to more powerful spells. you encounter
these before you start learning the spell or find multiple-use objects.

Random ideas:
Herbology: find mushrooms, plants underground


Code snippets:

onEquip() { // method run just after wearing item;
    GetRandomSeed();
    Item.RandomizeCurseStatus();
}

Idea for game object hierachy:

PlayerObject {
    // Everything to do with player
}
BoardManager { 
    // master class for the spatial division of the world into tiles (?)
    // in lore, the spatial plane
    // divided into zones
}

}
Dungeon {
    // dungeon zone - the building itself?
}    

Surface {
    // surface zone
}
